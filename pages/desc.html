        <h2>Deep Economy: The Wealth of Communities and Our Durable 
            Future</h2>
        <p>
            The OneBook for 2009-2010 is Deep Economy: The Wealth of Communities and Our Du-
            rable Future (2007) by one of the greatest environmental writers and activists in the U.S., Bill 
            McKibben. In Deep Economy, you will read about how our globalized economy has become 
            addicted to the ideas of limitless economic growth and endless consumption of goods. As 
            McKibben defines it, a deep economy “cares less about quantity than quality [and] takes as its 
            goal the production of human satisfaction as much as surplus material.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Deep Economy asserts that what we eat, what we drive, where we live and what we feel are 
            all related to how we use or misuse the earth's resources. This provocative book will make 
            you think about how you live your life every day and will challenge you to dream of a better 
            future.
