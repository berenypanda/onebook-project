        <h2>Deep Economy: The Wealth of Communities and Our Durable 
            Future</h2>
        <p>Deep Economy asserts that what we eat, what we drive, where we live and what we feel are 
            all related to how we use or misuse the earth's resources. This provocative book will make 
            you think about how you live your life every day and will challenge you to dream of a better 
            future.</p>
        <p>The OneBook theme for 2009-2010 is the central theme of Deep Economy: Sustainability. 
            Sustainability is the concept of using resources (such as fossil fuels or water) without deplet-
            ing or wasting them. Sustainability is about maintaining life and society through technologies, 
            policies and personal choices that help us use our planet's limited resources more effectively.</p>
