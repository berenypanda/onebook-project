        <p>The UT Arlington OneBook program is delighted to be hosting a visit to campus by 
         Bill McKibben, the author of this year's One-Book, <em>Deep Economy: The Wealth of Communities and Our Durable 
         Future (2007).</em> </p>
        <p>McKibben is possibly the most prolific, important and  influential environmental writer of our time. 
         His first book, <em>The End of Nature (1989)</em>, was a pioneering work of journalism on climate change that was hailed by reviewers as a 
         compelling, must-read about the future of our planet.  Subsequent books, such as <em>Hope, Human and Wild: True Stories of Living  Lightly on the Earth (1995)</em>, <em>Maybe One: 
         A Case for Smaller Families (1998)</em> and  <em>Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered  Age (2003)</em> explore sustainability, population 
         growth and the perils of technology and genetic engineering. McKibben's great stature and contribution to American environmental 
         writing is evidenced by the recent publication of a retrospective collection of his essays 
         titled <em>The Bill McKibben Reader (2008).</em></p>
         <p>Bill McKibben is more than just writer, though; he has been a tireless environmental activist. He has led two of the largest protests 
            against global warming in U.S. history, one in 2006 and the other in 2007.  McKibben also 
            founded Stepitup07.org, a website designed to help pressure the U.S. government toward 
            more sustainable policies on carbon emissions. </p>
         <p>After reading and discussing <em>Deep Economy</em>, join us to meet its accomplished and fascinating author!</p>
