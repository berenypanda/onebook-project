        <h2>Central Theme: Sustainability</h2>
        <p>
            The OneBook theme for 2009-2010 is the central theme of Deep Economy: Sustainability. 
            Sustainability is the concept of using resources (such as fossil fuels or water) without deplet-
            ing or wasting them. Sustainability is about maintaining life and society through technologies, 
            policies and personal choices that help us use our planet's limited resources more effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            The concept of Sustainability encompasses several overlapping domains that we will explore 
            in this study guide, our multi-media resources and many presentations and activities on cam-
            pus. We have prepared several icons to designate these domains, and to publicize on-campus 
            events that you will find helpful as you study the topic of Sustainability.
